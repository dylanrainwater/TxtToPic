TxtToPic
========

Input a text file, outputs a picture!

Example input and output:

test.txt: http://pastebin.com/15CJEiiy

console input: test.txt,true,3

// text.txt is referring to the text file, "true" is turning pattern mode on, pattern mode is

// when the colors are randomized, but the picture is still effected by the text file. Otherwise

// the picture uses 3 set colors.

Would output:
